As shown, my-cat reads the file main.c and prints out its contents. The "./" before the my-cat above is a UNIX thing; it just tells the system which directory to find my-cat in (in this case, in the "." (dot) directory, which means the current working directory).

To create the my-cat binary, you'll be creating a single source file, my-cat.c, and writing a little C code to implement this simplified version of cat. To compile this program, you will do the following:

prompt> gcc -o my-cat my-cat.c -Wall -Werror

prompt>
